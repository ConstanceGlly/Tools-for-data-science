This repository contains two folders for the two parts of this exercice. Each one has a dedicated README file to detail its purpose and how to deploy the streamlit application.

The *"Uber"* folder contains the first part of the course with the deployment of a summary of KPIs from the uber data. 

The *"Arriere_Plan"* folder contains the second part of the assignment with my own application that aims at removing an image background and modify it.
